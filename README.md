<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm CHIA THUNG THUNG</h1>
<h3 align="center">You can call me THUNG THUNG. I'm from NEGERI SEMBILAN but I came to JOHOR for study after my secondary school. Interesting right! Initially I was studied at KOLEJ MATRIKULASI KEJURUTERAAN JOHOR (KMKJ). I felt homesick very much because all my family and friends are not around me. So it became my biggest challenge rather than my studies. Finally, I found a way to against my problem, I decide to call my family everyday and we will share our daily life with each other. It works until my matrikulasi graduated. And now, I came to UNIVERSITI TEKNOLOGI MALAYSIA (UTM) to study. I'm currently learning COMPUTER SCIENCE - NETWORK AND SECURITY which is the subject I didn't learn before. Well, I think JOHOR has became my second hometown HAHAHA.</h3>
